// To get back to start position after practicing roll out with soldier type 'getpos' in console
// Now a bunch of random numbers with the phrase setpos at the beginning will show up at the bottom of your console.
// Now copy everything from "setpos" to the last number. You can easily tell what to copy because the letters are red.
// Now type in the console:
// bind "key of choice" (don't put the command in yet though)
// After the parentheses press Space once and then put in your own set of parentheses " ". Now paste everything that you just copied between the empty parentheses. Make sure EVERYTHING got pasted in as often times number get left out. The finished product should look like; (just an example, yours will likely be different).
// bind "o" "setpos 09502345 32982505454 3553725359"
// Or directly paste setpos 09502345 32982505454 3553725359 in console if you don't want to bind it to a key.
// Now you can put the command into the console. This allows you to return to the exact position on the map that you first typed in getpos at by pressing the key that you assigned it to.
